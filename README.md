Hey, I'm Tegar Wijaya Kusuma, a Computer Science student based in Tangerang, Indonesia. Passionate about backend development and test automation. Currently exploring DevOps tools like Docker and building CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

## Overview

This repository contains the main standalone projects I've built throughout the Udemy course: **[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)**.

While my [python-100-days-of-code-practice](https://github.com/Coraa-12/python-100-days-of-code-practice) repository tracks daily exercises and smaller code snippets, this repository focuses on the complete, deployable projects created during the course.

## Projects Collection

## Highlights

Here are some of the more advanced projects I'm particularly proud of:

*(This section will be updated as I progress through the course and complete more complex projects)*

## Technologies & Concepts

Through these projects, I'm developing skills in:

- Python fundamentals and advanced features
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Web development with Flask
- API integration
- Data analysis with Pandas
- Web scraping
- Automation
- Game development
- Data visualization
- Database management (SQL & NoSQL)
- Machine learning basics

## How to Use

Each project folder contains:
- Source code
- A README with instructions
- Any necessary resources or assets

To run a project:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md file
3. Most projects can be run with: `python main.py`

## Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I build increasingly complex Python applications. I'm committed to consistent daily practice and hands-on learning.
